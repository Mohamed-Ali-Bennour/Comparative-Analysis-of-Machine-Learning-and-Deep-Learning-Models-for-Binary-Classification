# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Binary-Classification
# Project Overview

This project evaluates and compares the performance of six models—three machine learning models and three deep learning models—on a binary classification task using the Mushroom Dataset. The models include:

- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- **Deep Learning Models**: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Each model's performance is assessed using key metrics: **Accuracy**, **F1-score**, and the **Confusion Matrix**. The Confusion Matrix helps to analyze misclassifications and evaluate how well each model distinguishes between the two classes.

# Key Findings:

- **Random Forest** (Machine Learning) achieved **99% accuracy**, performing the best.
- **RNN** (Deep Learning) achieved **97% accuracy**, leveraging LSTM layers.
- **CNN** (Deep Learning) followed with **95% accuracy**, excelling at capturing feature patterns.
- **ANN** (Deep Learning) achieved **66% accuracy**, learning non-linear patterns but performing lower than others.
